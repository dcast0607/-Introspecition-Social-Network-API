# Introspecition-Social-Network-API

The "Introspection Social Network API" is a back-end API that aims to replicate some of the functionality that is offered by some of the modern social network companies of today. The API has been built to allow you to interact with three different objects; users object, thoughts object, and reactions object. 

* Users object
    * Create a new user
    * Retrieve an existing user
    * Update an existing user
    * Delete an existing user

* Thoughts Object
    * Create a new thought
    * Retrieve an existing thought
    * Update an existing thought
    * Delete an existing thought

* Reactions Object
    * Create a new reaction
    * Delete an existing reaction

## Testing Through Our Postman Collection

I've created a postman collection that you can use to test the Introspection API. Although the API is pretty self-explanatory, please make sure that you read through the README to fully understand the functionality of this API.

#### Notes: 

To make your life easier, I recommend that you take advantage of the variables that I've included. This will make it much easier to test against different environments, this will also make it easier to update your queries as you test the API.
