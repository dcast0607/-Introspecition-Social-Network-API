# Introspecition-Social-Network-API

## Postman Collection

I've created a postman collection that you can use to test the Introspection API. Although the API is pretty self-explanatory, please make sure that you read through the README to fully understand the functionality of this API.

#### Notes: 

To make your life easier, I recommend that you take advantage of the variables that I've included. This will make it much easier to test against different environments, this will also make it easier to update your queries as you test the API.
